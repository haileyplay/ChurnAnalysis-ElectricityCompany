# Churn Analysis for Electricity Company
This is an assignment done during my master study about data analysis  where R coding language is applied. A dataset of 20,000 customers with information on their demographics, houses, energy usage, contract period, and churn behavior is provided.Â 

**Business Problem**: High customer churn rate affects company profitability and growth. We applied statistical analysis and visualisation to understand the reason for customer churn.


## Features

- **Hypothesis**: 6 hypotheses are derived on the relationship between relationship length, gender, age, income, contract type, acquisition channel, and churn
  
- **Data Preparation**: Prepare clean data in the correct formate for further analysis. Also to eliminate outliers to achieve normal distribution

- **Graphs and Summary Statistics**: Histograms, blox plots are applied to visualize data distribution
